#About the App

This Movie App is my Personal Project as a self-taught Front-end Developer.

#Technologies Used

I create this App using Vite + React
Tailwind CSS as my CSS framework and I used Material UI to the Pagination and Headless ui in the Modal component
TMDb API as my API or Backend
And finally I deploy the App in the Netlify
